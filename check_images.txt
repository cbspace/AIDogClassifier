Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three models classified teh breed of dog correctly


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three models correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same as Dog_02.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three models correctly classified the non-dog images.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: It was not possible to select a model based on classification performance alone as all three models were 100% accurate at classification tasks. This was due to the small data set (4 images).
        For this reason my selection was based on time to completion as the amount of computer power required is a signification deciding factor. Alexnet performed the best in this regard with
        a completion time of 1 second on the Udacity Workspace. This was followed by Resnet with 4 seconds and VGG with 8 seconds. This difference in compute power requirements would add up very quickly
        with a larger data set.
