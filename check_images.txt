Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three models classified the breed of dog correctly


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three models correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same as Dog_02.jpg


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three models correctly classified the non-dog images as not dogs. It is noted that coffee mug image was correctly identified by VGG and Resnet however it was incorrectly identified as a water jug by Alexnet.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All three models performed the same for the dog images and correctly classifed the images as dogs of the correct breed (Dalmatian). The three models correctly identified the bird image however only VGG and Resenet correctly identified the coffee mug.
        When choosing a model to use the two most important factors are accuary and speed (computing power requirement). My selected model is Resnet as it has a high level of accuaracy and required half the compute power of the most accurate model (VGG). 
        In my opinion the additional ~3% accuaracy in dog breed classification obtained from VGG is not worth double the compute requirements.
